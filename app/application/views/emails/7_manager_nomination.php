Dear <?php echo $manager_name ?>,

<?php echo $volunteer_name ?> has nominated you as a manager in the Staff Volunteering Programme.

Durham University operates an employer supported volunteering scheme, enabling University staff members to volunteer for up to 5 days per year during work-time. The time can be taken as full days, half-days or a few hours here and there. This scheme is managed by the Staff Volunteering and Outreach Team.

While staff do have the opportunity to request up to 5 days a year for volunteering work, this is subject to a line-manager approval.

If you accept the nomination we will reach out to you when participants managed by you request volunteering shifts. You will then be able to approve or decline the request.
